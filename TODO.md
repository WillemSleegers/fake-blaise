# Survey App - UI Fixes

## Pending

## In Progress

## Completed

- [x] Add a light-blue color as background: rgb(192, 232, 243)
- [x] The main content should have a left border with this color: rgb(39, 29, 108) and be 10px wide
- [x] The table of contents should have a light blue background: rgb(230, 250, 255), a gray text color for unvisited pages (rgb(128, 128, 128)), a dark blue color for visited and currently active pages (rgb(39, 29, 108)) and only have a hover state showing the cursor, no underlines.
- [x] The background color of the main content should be white
- [x] text color should be updated and be dark blue: rgb(39, 29, 108)
- [x] Remove rounding from elements; the look doesn't have any rounded colors
- [x] The table of contents should have a fixed width of 250px and height of 450px
- [x] In the TOC, the 'Inhoudsopgave' section should have the same background and font size as the other text in the TOC. The only difference should be that the TOC contents should be slightly more indented (by 5px)
- [x] The main page content should have a height matching the window size
- [x] I guess it's more confusing to not have the components have a prefix, so maybe let's add a prefix, but let's have the prefix be 'Blaise'
- [x] The font should be 'Verdana, sans-serif' throughout
- [x] Align the header actions section to the top
- [x] Put a top and bottom margin of 18px on the CBS logo
- [x] The survey title should have the dark blue background color that it currently has, but its container should not span the whole width. The container should actually only cover the width of the survey title itself, with a 48px left margin.
- [x] Add a 40px left margin to the CBS logo.
